# Welcome to my profile!

Hi, I'm Lisa! I mainly code in PHP and MySQL, but sometimes I use HTML, CSS, JS and Java, too.

## I’m currently learning:
- 🌱 AL for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central
- 🌱 The Symfony framework
- 🌱 Python development
- 🌱 The WebGPU API and its WGSL shader language

## My projects:
- 🐎 Equidea's World, a browser-based horse simulation game currently in development
- 🐴 Wilder Reiter, a German browser-based horse sim game currently in development
- :paw_prints: Vyxen3D, an open-source 3D rendering engine written in JavaScript using the WebGPU API
